## Project Description

torrust-index is a feature-rich torrent indexing website for the [torrust-tracker](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker).

    ### Need
    -----------
    The reason behind this project was that Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH needed a solution that makes it easy for anyone with a computer and internet connection to share their files with the rest of the world.

    ### Approach
    ---------------
    We will develop a BitTorrent tracker with a private and public tracker option and a web application for uploading and downloading torrents that are being tracked by the BitTorrent tracker.
    
    ### Benefit
    --------------
    Anyone will be able to host a (private) BitTorrent tracker and online torrent index with ease. And now they can share their digital content on their own torrent index :).

### Features

- [X] User authentication
- [X] E-mail verification
- [X] Torrent sharing
- [X] Torrent searching & filtering
- [X] Private tracker compatible
- [X] Content & user moderation tools
- [X] Website customization

### Roadmap

*Coming soon.*
